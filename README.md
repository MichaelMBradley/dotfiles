# Dotfiles

I use Arch Linux with Hyprland, Rofi, and EWW.
The dotfiles are managed with TOML Bombadil.

## TODO:
* Add links
* Fix dark mode files
* Update screenshot
* Add laptop-related configuration
* Finish setting up EWW
* Fix startup terminal layout
* Fix swaylock redscreen when started from EWW
